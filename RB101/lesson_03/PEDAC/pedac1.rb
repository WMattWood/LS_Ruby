# input: string
# output: new string (not the same object)
# rules:
#     Explicit requirements:
#       - all palindromes must be capitalized
#       - palindromes are case sensitive (ie. 'Dad' is not a palindrome, 'dad' is.)

#     Implicit requirements:
#       - the returned string shouldn't be the same object.
#       - if input is an empty string, the result should be an empty string.
