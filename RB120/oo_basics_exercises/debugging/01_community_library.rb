# This exercise demonstrates the concept of encapsulation. We create an
# interface for the user within the Library class, keeping the Book class'
# instance methods for internal use only within the program. This creates
# a more uniform and limited "surface area of access" to our program.

# Keeping the interface simple and limited can be a powerful tool in designing
# the user experience - or alternatively in simplifying the job of the next
# software developer when it comes time to connect the code to UI elements.
# The code can be approached with a simple streamlined mental model.
